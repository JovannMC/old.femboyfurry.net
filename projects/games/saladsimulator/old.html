                    This is the first game I ever released to the public. It is very scuffed and is based on Salad.
                    This has <i>some</i> gameplay and definitely has more features than my other game, <a href="/projects/saladclicker.html">Salad Clicker</a>.<br>
                <br>
                    You utilize Salad to earn money with your PC, and with that money, you use it to upgrade your PC to earn more money.
                    It features a scuffed house, a computer, going outside (which breaks the game), and of course the Salad app itself.
                    The computer has a half-broken GPU tuner and a web browser where you can visit Omazing:tm: to buy your hardware.<br>
                <br>
                    If you want to play the game, you can play it online through the main site, or download it.<br>
