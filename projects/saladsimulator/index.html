                    This game is in the very early stages, so it is currently very scuffed. The game is based off Salad.
                    Looking for the old version? You can find it <a href="/projects/saladsimulator/old.html">here</a>.<br>
                <br>
                    You utilize Salad to earn money with your PC, and with that money, you use it to upgrade your PC to earn more money.
                    Currently it features a computer running AvocadOS. It has a web browser and the Salad app itself.
